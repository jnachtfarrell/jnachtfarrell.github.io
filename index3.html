<h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>

<p>I'm am Education StartUp Junkie living in NYC. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I work at General Assemb.ly and I need some street cred.</p> 

<h2><strong>My Mission</strong></h2>

<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work in my current profession as head of Business Development and Marketing, but want to be able to work more closely with technical professionals because I like to work in a fast moving start up environment.</p>
